## The Hands-Down Best Peanut Butter Cookie Recipe

Peanut butter cookies hold a special place in the hearts of many, often considered a timeless classic. Whether you're looking to make a batch for a family gathering or simply to satisfy your sweet tooth, this recipe is sure to become a favorite. Here’s a comprehensive guide to making the best peanut butter cookies, complete with variations, storage tips, and more.

### Ingredients
- **1 cup unsalted butter** (softened)
- **1 cup creamy peanut butter** (or crunchy for added texture)
- **1 cup granulated sugar**
- **1 cup packed brown sugar**
- **2 large eggs**
- **2 ½ cups all-purpose flour**
- **1 ½ teaspoons baking soda**
- **1 teaspoon baking powder**
- **½ teaspoon salt**

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

3. **Combine the Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

4. **Mix Dry and Wet Ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

5. **Chill the Dough**: For best results, chill the dough for at least 1-2 hours. This helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much while baking.

6. **Shape the Cookies**: Roll the dough into 1-inch balls. Place them on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie. Use a fork to create a crisscross pattern on top of each cookie, dipping the fork in sugar to prevent sticking.

7. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 9-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.

8. **Cool**: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Tips for the Best Peanut Butter Cookies
- **Use Quality Peanut Butter**: Stick to a well-known brand of creamy peanut butter (like Skippy or Jif) for the best texture and taste. Natural peanut butter can yield a grittier texture.
- **Chill the Dough**: Chilling the dough for a few hours helps maintain the cookie shape and prevents excessive spreading.
- **Use Sugar on the Fork**: Dipping the fork in sugar before pressing down on the dough will help prevent it from sticking.

### Fun Variations
- **Roll in Sugar**: Before making the fork marks, roll the dough balls in granulated sugar for an extra sweet touch.
- **Add a Hershey’s Kiss**: Instead of making the fork pattern, leave the dough in balls and bake as directed. Press a chocolate Hershey's kiss into the center immediately after removing from the oven.
- **Use Almond Butter**: For a nutty twist, substitute peanut butter with almond butter.

### Storage and Freezing
- **Storing Baked Cookies**: Keep baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
- **Freezing Baked Cookies**: To freeze, place the cookies in a single layer in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper. They can last up to 3 months.
- **Freezing Cookie Dough**: Roll cookie dough into balls, place them on a lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.

### Conclusion
Peanut butter cookies are a beloved treat that can be enjoyed in various forms. Whether you prefer them soft and chewy or with a chocolate surprise in the middle, this recipe is versatile and easy to follow. Happy baking!
